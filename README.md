## Updated for the NIST CSF v1.1 update from 2018 ##
### Updated with CIS v8.0 release (2021)

These excel documents provide a visual view of the NIST CyberSecurity Framework (CSF), adding in additional 
fields to manage to the framework.

Basic sections: 
 - a CMMI reference sheet 
 - Main sheet has collapsible sections for ease of display and management
 - The CSF sub-categories are listed, expanding the Information Security Catalog to address each sub control
 - The maturity functions are auto-calculated based on 4 areas: Process, Policy, Documentation, and Automation

## Key components of these tools: 
 - Track the CSF controls individually
 - Prioritize risk using the CIS Controls (formerly the Critical Security Controls)
 - Document solutions used to meet the controls via a service catalog
 - Track budgetary requests to improve or maintain controls
 - Document current maturity in each control and maturity goals, using the CMMI model
 - Document a 3-5 year plan, tracking projects and recurring functions

Users can modify the tool to support alternate maturity models (ex: CSF recommends tiers). All data is fictitious and is represented as an example. Please update to reflect actual service catalog products and solutions as well as actual maturity and projects.

# Sensitive_Info_Table
The sensitive information table is designed as a quick reference to publish in our organization, designed to help people understand potential compliance requirements based on various data fields. The document specifically addresses PCI, PHI, and PII. This can be adapted to include additional types. The Oregon laws are added due to our organization residing in Oregon. If you are outside Oregon, research your state/country laws and compliance as needed.
